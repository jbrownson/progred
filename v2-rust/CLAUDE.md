# Development Notes

## Cargo Build Cache

Cursor's sandbox sets `CARGO_HOME` and `RUSTUP_HOME` to temporary directories. This causes cache invalidation when alternating between terminal and Cursor builds.

When running cargo commands, unset these:

```bash
unset CARGO_HOME RUSTUP_HOME && cargo build
```

## Future Considerations

- `muda` crate for native OS menus (instead of egui menus)

## Code Style

- Very limited comments — code should be self-documenting
- Expression-oriented where possible
- Prefer long expressions broken across multiple lines over multiple statements with intermediate names — naming is hard, avoid unnecessary names
- Factor out common assignments: `x = if cond { a } else { b }` not `if cond { x = a } else { x = b }`
- Functional style: iterator chains, `try_fold`, `filter_map`, `std::array::from_fn` over mutable accumulators and loops where it doesn't make things worse
- Avoid `let mut` when a functional alternative is equally clear
- No `isX()` predicate methods — use `matches!` or pattern matching at the call site
- Eliminate partial functions: use `split_first`/`split_last` over manual indexing
- Return references for non-trivial types (let caller decide to clone), but methods on small structs (like `Document`) enable disjoint borrow checking over methods on the parent (`ProgredApp`)
- Avoid early returns — prefer `if let`, `match`, or expression-oriented alternatives over `let-else return` / `return` in closures
- Dead code should be deleted, not commented out
- Push back if something seems wrong
